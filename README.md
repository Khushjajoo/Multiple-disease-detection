This project is an interactive, ML-powered web app built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of three critical health conditions: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Using pre-trained SVM models developed with scikit-learn and trained on real-world medical datasets, the app allows users to input clinical parameters and receive instant, data-driven predictions. Each disease module is tailored with its own set of inputs and seamlessly integrated into a clean, user-friendly interface. Designed with accessibility and early detection in mind, this tool showcases how machine learning can support faster, more informed health assessments
